++Clipboard is an easy way to share a clipboard between different computers. 

Whenever you need to move a code, an URL, or anything else from one computer to
another, you usually have few choices: you either copy the whole thing, letter 
by letter, or you use an URL shortener/nopaste service. In both cases, you will
have to type something. I spent like 10 minutes staring at a string I wanted to
transfer to another computer, and I thought it would have been awesome if I
could Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V it on my laptop: that's pretty much why I wrote this
tool :-).

++Clipboard requires php and xclip to be installed and available. I sure could
have written the whole thing without them, but I wasn't willing to waste my life
on it :-).

The setting up is rather easy, you only need to upload the file ppclipboard.php
somewhere, and install ppcc.php and ppcv.sh under /usr/local/bin:

# install -o0 -g0 -m755 ppcc.php ppcv.sh /usr/local/bin

You should edit the files and choose a safe password, so that nobody but you can
see/edit your clipboard. Also, don't forget to specify the URL of your 
ppclipboard.php file in ppcc.php and ppcv.sh. 

All right, now that everything's set up, you only need to create a couple of
shortcuts to launch the scripts: as for me, I edited my ~/.fluxbox/keys file as
follows (note: different Desktop Enviroments require different methods):

Control Shift C : ExecCommand ppcc.php
Control Shift V : ExecCommand ppcv.sh

I guess that's pretty much it :-) Let me know if you find this useful: if enough
people is interested in it, I might as well start working on a more complex and
better written version ;-).
